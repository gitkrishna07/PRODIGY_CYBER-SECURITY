Here's how the script works:

The password_strength function takes a password as input and assesses its strength based on the criteria mentioned above.
It uses regular expressions to check for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
It assigns a score from 0 to 4 based on the number of criteria met.
The main function prompts the user to enter a password and calls the password_strength function to assess its strength.
The script prints out the password strength level based on the score.
You can run this script and test it with different passwords to see how it assesses their strength.
