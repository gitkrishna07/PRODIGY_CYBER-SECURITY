Here's how the program works:
The caesar_cipher function takes three arguments: text (the input message), shift (the shift value), and direction (either "encrypt" or "decrypt").
The function iterates through each character in the input message.
If the character is a letter, it calculates the new character code using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The ascii_offset variable is used to handle uppercase and lowercase letters separately.
If the direction is "encrypt", the function adds the shift value to the character code. If the direction is "decrypt", it subtracts the shift value.
The function uses the modulo operator (% 26) to ensure that the character code stays within the range of 0 to 25 (the number of letters in the alphabet).
The function returns the encrypted or decrypted message.
The main function provides a menu-driven interface for the user to choose between encryption, decryption, and quitting the program.
Depending on the user's choice, the program prompts for input and calls the caesar_cipher function with the appropriate arguments.
You can save this code to a file (e.g., caesar_cipher.py,task1.py) and run it using Python (e.g., python caesar_cipher.py,python task1.py). Then, follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm!
